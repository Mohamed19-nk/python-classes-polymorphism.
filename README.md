
# 🏗️ Python OOP Assignment

This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python, including class creation, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

---

## Assignment 1: Superhero Class 🦸‍♂️

- Creates a base class `Character`
- Inherits to `Superhero` with added powers
- Uses encapsulation to hide the power attribute

---

## Activity 2: Polymorphism with Vehicles 🚗✈️🚤

- Defines a common `move()` method in the base class
- Subclasses override the method with unique behavior
- Demonstrates polymorphism in action

---

## How to Run

```bash
python superhero.py
python polymorphism_demo.py
